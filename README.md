# Fair Classification Systems

## Description

The Fair Classification Systems project focuses on building multi-class classification systems that incorporate demographic parity to ensure fairness in decision-making. The goal is to develop models that perform well on classification tasks while maintaining fairness across different demographic groups. This project demonstrates advanced skills in fairness in machine learning, multi-class classification, and the implementation of demographic parity.

## Skills Demonstrated

- **Fairness in Machine Learning:** Techniques to ensure that machine learning models do not exhibit bias towards any demographic group.
- **Multi-Class Classification:** Building and evaluating models that can classify instances into one of several categories.
- **Demographic Parity:** Implementing methods to ensure that the probability of positive outcomes is the same across different demographic groups.

## Use Cases

- **HR Recruitment:** Ensuring fair hiring practices by developing models that do not discriminate based on gender, race, or other demographics.
- **Loan Approval Systems:** Creating fair loan approval models that ensure equal access to credit for all demographic groups.
- **Judicial Decision Support:** Developing fair decision support systems for judicial use to avoid bias in sentencing and parole decisions.

## Components

### 1. Data Collection and Preprocessing

Collect and preprocess data to ensure it is clean, consistent, and ready for analysis.

- **Data Sources:** HR datasets, financial datasets, judicial records.
- **Techniques Used:** Data cleaning, normalization, feature extraction, handling missing data.

### 2. Fairness Metrics

Implement and evaluate fairness metrics to assess the performance of the classification models.

- **Techniques Used:** Demographic parity, equal opportunity, disparate impact.
- **Libraries/Tools:** AIF360, fairlearn.

### 3. Multi-Class Classification

Develop and train multi-class classification models to predict outcomes based on input features.

- **Techniques Used:** Logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, neural networks.
- **Libraries/Tools:** scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch.

### 4. Fairness Constraints

Apply fairness constraints to the classification models to ensure demographic parity.

- **Techniques Used:** Post-processing methods, in-processing methods, pre-processing methods.
- **Libraries/Tools:** AIF360, fairlearn.

### 5. Evaluation and Validation

Evaluate the performance of the classification models using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and fairness metrics.

- **Metrics Used:** Accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, demographic parity, equal opportunity, disparate impact.

### 6. Deployment

Deploy the fair classification models in real-world applications to support decision-making processes.

- **Tools Used:** Flask, Docker, AWS/GCP/Azure.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or above
- Required libraries listed in `requirements.txt`

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/fair_classification_systems.git
   cd fair_classification_systems
   ```

2. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Data Preparation

1. Place raw data files in the `data/raw/` directory.
2. Run the data preprocessing script to prepare the data:
   ```bash
   python src/data_preprocessing.py
   ```

### Running the Notebooks

1. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

2. Open and run the notebooks in the `notebooks/` directory to preprocess data, develop models, apply fairness constraints, and evaluate the system:

   - `evaluation.ipynb`

### Training and Evaluation

1. Train the multi-class classification models:
   ```bash
   python src/multi_class_classification.py --train
   ```

2. Apply fairness constraints to the models:
   ```bash
   python src/fairness_constraints.py --apply
   ```

3. Evaluate the models:
   ```bash
   python src/evaluation.py --evaluate
   ```

### Deployment

1. Deploy the fair classification models using Flask:
   ```bash
   python src/deployment.py
   ```
